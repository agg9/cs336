a.
Successful commands

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/request

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg": "POST"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg": "PUT"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg": "DELETE"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

CHROME GET and POST

FOR HEAD:
	this didn't work: curl [--head] http://localhost:3000/request
		-gave me some bad range error
	this did: curl -I http://localhost:3000/request

b.  The most appropriate HTTP response would be a NOT_FOUND

a. Both GET and POST methods support forms
