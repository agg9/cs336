Vision Statement

I believe a good project would be creating a web app for carpooling, and study groups. 
When I was an underclassman, there were often times I could never attend church, 
university sporting events, or other venues, because I didn’t have access to 
transportation. Creating a website that would allow students to find rides together would 
offer a solution to this issue. Not only would it be good for those who don’t have access 
to transportation, it would be good for students who want to save money. 
Also, as a transfer student I often don’t know anyone in my classes. 
Being able to find other students in similar situations would be greatly beneficial 
for doing assignments and studying. This project could be a good tool for students of 
all grade levels to use.
