13.1 Questions
	What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
		- Added dynamic route matching, and also uses browsing history to easily restore state without breaking the site.
	Which is better, hash history or browser history?
		- hash history
	Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.
		- The server needs to be modified so our website delievers teh app no matter what URL comes in, since the app is manipulating the URl and the server doesn't know how to handle it.


13.2 Questions
	What state does the new CommentEdit component maintain and how does that compare with the state maintained by the CommentBox component?
		-I don't totall understand this quesiton.  
	What does the CommentEdit component do when the AJAX PUT or DELETE methods return successfully? How does this compare with what the “Cancel” button provided by the CommentEdit component does?
		-The component makes changes in the virtualDOM object and refreshes to the original state.  The Cancel button just returns back to the page without doing anything else.
	How is the Link added in the last step different from a simple HTML hyperlink?
		- The Lnk is active, and loads with linked page with the application.  Using a html hyperlink will need to process a request to open up and load the next page.
