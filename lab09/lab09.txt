	What good has this bundling done? How big is the new bundle file? Check the Chrome DevTools network log to see what files are being loaded.
		- the bundle.js file is massive.
	What role did Babel play in the bundling?
		- it allows the browser to understand the code
	Can you just load file:///path…/index.html using the browser? Why or why not?
		- No, it does not work.
	In webpack.config.js, what does the loader test entry test: /\.jsx?$/ do?
		- it is regex to determine file extensions


9.2 Questions
	Check out the new dist/index.html and dist/bundle.js. How are they different from the previous versions?

	What good is it to replace the CDN library loads with module imports?

9.3 Questions
	Try out both ports and explain the difference between them.
		localhost:3001 — Try editing one of the React module files. Explain what happens, both to the displayed SPA webpage and to the bundle/index files.
			-The webpack automatically recompiles

		localhost:3000 — Try loading /api/comments. Explain what you get. Does the SPA page running on this port change (due to the edits made above) as well?
			-I am getting all of the comments in JSON format

	Is it worth all this trouble to build a development configuration?
		-I don't think so.  It was very complicated and produces the same result.
