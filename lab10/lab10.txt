10.1 Questions
	Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are 
		there things that one can do that the other can’t?
	- Both databases are fairly easy to use and maintain dat.  One main difference if that in the SQL databases, data has been in row, column format.  But in
		the mongoDB it is in key value pairs. Also, the mongoDB schema is dynamic.   

	You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages 
		would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?
	- One advantage would be that it would be fast, however any other applications
		would be unable to access the database.

	You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a 
		production database? Why or why not?
	-No it is not.  First of all, it doesn't hold a lot of space.  The performance for a 
		production probably wouldn't be good and the security isn't that strict for the sandbox.

10.2 Questions
	For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment (npm run dev)? Why?
		-NPM start.  Whenever i use npm run dev, I get errors.
	Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.
		-It updates the app after about 2 - 3 seconds.  It is slower than using the application.
	Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
		-noSQL.  when using comments we don't need a relational database.  Using a noSQL will be easier for this type of application as well as perform better.
